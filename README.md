# Marvel
I am in love with Marvel! I first started being in love with Spider Man. My very first super hero. After watching Spider Man, I was watching Captain America, Wonder Women, and my number one girl Wanda Maximoff. 
To be quite honest, I am in love with all Marvel! However, what is the very first Marvel Movie or show? What Year? When did all these Marvel come in? So many questions, and not a website to state it all!
This project is going to be my very first REAL project. I am going to create you a one shot spot where you can get the history of all the questions you have! I will have some exciting features and hoping, land a 
job with Disney for creating this. LOL. (just kidding) but I do hope <3 Hi Disney!! 

I will make this my 100 hour project track my time, create a sketch, answer any questions you have about this project. I hope you enjoy it just as much as I enjoy being happy Stress and happy Fustrated in creating this for you all.
Stay Tuned!
